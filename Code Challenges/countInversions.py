#Challenge: Count inversions in an array
#           Inversion Count for an array indicates â€“ how far (or close) the 
#           array is from being sorted. If array is already sorted then 
#           inversion count is 0. If array is sorted in reverse order that 
#           inversion count is the maximum. 
#           Formally speaking, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if 
#           a[i] > a[j] and i < j
